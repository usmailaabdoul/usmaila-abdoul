          Touch of Grace is a cleaning company based in Texas and this website is built to showcases their services 
          and offering including the different programs they offer. We also intergrate and API endpoint to track user quate requests 
          through a custom CSM built specifically for this website, it collects basic user information including the type of service they
          are interested in and submits this to the CSM which handles sending the appropraite emails to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use google analytics to see how users interact with the website and how users that visit the website actually request a quote and complete the requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website was built to be very user friend and responsive and all devices, other perfomance improvements like lazy loading images and using SSR to load pages
          and services before initial page mount making sure there is no loading and delays improving overall user experience while navigating the website.
